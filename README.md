# Introduction

This is a sample set of code from my 'Innovation CoPilot', which I built for the Innovation practice area of the Boston Consulting Group. 
Much of the code has been redacted and simplified in order to provide a simple 'starter' chatbot from which you can build a more complex chatbot for your use case!

The full article with additional details and context can be found here: [article link]
